<h2><b>Recommendation System for Better Student's Performance in Campus</b></h2>

Data mining algorithm is a boon to the huge meaningless data. Our Institute consist huge amount of data which remains useless if not use properly. Our attempt was to make those huge data producible and helpful for the students only. As placement is one of the major issues now-a-days so it is the requirement for any institute or colleges to focus to their student’s performance regarding to the placement vision to improve placement count as well as students progress.<br/><br/>
Various institute data which comprises of academic marks, curricular activities which shows their personality, and campus placement requirements like their aptitude knowledge screening can be achieved with the help of data mining algorithms and by processing these huge data.<br/><br/> 
In this project we have used Flask framework to deal with python connectivity with the web application. Since every student must be able to get their performance status prior to the campus selection stage it is necessary for them to be focused in their lagging from the beginning itself. Also, TNP faculties must be helped with the system which can help them to recommend companies the name of the students who are fit for their criteria without spending lot of time in filtering the students.<br/><br/>
The dataset which we achieved is from our college TNP (Training and placement cell). Some data have been created by us using excel programming. Input forms from students will convert the student’s data into relevant rows
The projects consist of following directories-
1.	 Static – In this folder we have css files and images for css files
2.	Templates – Tn this folder we have all the html files
3.	Pkl_files – To store the data mining algorithm model
<br/>
We have used 6 data mining algorithms and our study on the dataset we used shows more for Support Vector Machine algorithm. The screenshots have been provided in the Algorithm_classification_report folder.
